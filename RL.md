## Reinforcement learning  
Reinforcement learning(RL) is a subclass of machine learning, and the Agent of RL can learn to perform action in an environment in order to maximize the reward.
In the same time the environment will feedback reward and state to the agent.   
According to policy the RL can be divided into off-policy and on-policy algorithm.
* off-policy: the Agent will take random policy to exploration .(with help of e-greedy)  
* on-policy: the Agent will take the same policy to select actions.
