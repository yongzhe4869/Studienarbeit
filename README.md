# Studienarbeit


## Meetings
We meet every Monday at 3 pm. [Read the meeting minutes here](meetings.md)



## State of the Art
The description & basic algorithm of classic Handover and the state of the art of Handover based on RL is wroten in [here](Handover.md)  

## System Model
The system model is based on NS3(LTE Handover model) and RL agent using Python.  
The draft of it is described in [here](System_Model.md)  
##  RL Agent
I have summarized something about Reinforcement learning and designed a simple Agent using stable_baselines3 in [here](RL.md)
