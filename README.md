# Studienarbeit


## Meeting Minutes
## 07.06.2021
* Started literature review (needs to be more precise, maybe use a table?).
* Goal is to get an overview of the problem domain (handovers) first, then we formulate a precise task description.
* List handover terms / variables (e.g., A1-A4 events, handover rate, etc.) and explain them shortly. How are they used by handover algorithms?
* How can the performance of handover algorithms be measured (e.g., see [1])? Create a list of metrics.

## 14.06.2021
* Add new columns to RL table (state, action, reward)
* Clarify time-to-trigger (TTT)
* `ns3` only uses triggered measurement reports (no periodic reports)
